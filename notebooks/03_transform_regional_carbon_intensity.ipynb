    "### Notebook Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "### Primary Goals\n",
    "- **Transform raw NESO regional carbon intensity data** into clean, analysis-ready format\n",
    "- **Standardize datetime handling** across all energy datasets\n",
    "- **Create consistent regional mapping** for geographic analysis\n",
    "- **Generate summary statistics** and data quality reports for carbon intensity trends\n",
    "\n",
    "### User Stories\n",
    "> **As a data analyst**, I want clear documentation and explanations for each NESO dataset we extract so that I and other team members can understand the source, structure, meaning and caveats of the data without digging into code.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **As a climate researcher**, I want standardized regional carbon intensity data so that I can easily identify the cleanest and dirtiest electricity by time and location across Great Britain.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **As an energy consumer**, I want reliable carbon intensity transformation pipelines so that I can trust insights about when and where to use electricity most sustainably.\n",
    "\n",
    "### About This Dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "### Source: NESO Regional Carbon Intensity\n",
    "- **Update Frequency**: Daily\n",
    "- **Time Resolution**: 30-minute intervals\n",

    "**c. K-Nearest Neighbors Imputation (Balanced Approach)**\n",
    "Find timestamps with similar generation mix patterns (fuel types, total generation, renewable percentages) and impute missing regional carbon intensity values based on these similar energy conditions. KNN captures non-linear relationships between generation mix and carbon intensity while being computationally efficient and preserving realistic energy patterns from actual historical data.\n",
    "\n",
    "**d. Temporal Pattern Analysis**\n",
    "Analyse cyclical patterns (hourly, daily, weekly, seasonal) in each region's carbon intensity and impute missing values based on temporal similarity. Uses techniques like seasonal decomposition or Fourier analysis to identify recurring patterns. Limited by its inability to account for variable renewable generation or fuel mix changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "**e. Simple Statistical Imputation**\n",
    "Replace missing values with statistical measures (mean, median, mode) calculated from available regional data. While computationally simple, this approach ignores temporal patterns, generation mix influences, and can introduce bias by flattening natural variations in carbon intensity.\n",
    "\n",
    "**f. Case Deletion**\n",
    "Remove all records containing missing values from the analysis. This preserves data integrity but reduces dataset size by 0-2.2%, potentially losing valuable information and introducing selection bias if missing data patterns are not random.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Current Plan:** KNN imputation provides the best balance of accuracy and computational efficiency for this energy dataset, leveraging the strong relationship between generation mix and carbon intensity while preserving realistic temporal patterns."
